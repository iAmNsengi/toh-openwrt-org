# CHANGELOG

OpenWrtTOH enhances the user experience of the
OpenWrt Table of Hardware (ToH) by providing a
much faster user interface and
offering straightforward options for controlling which
(of the seventy or so) columns are shown,
which models are shown, and
ultimately which (of the 2600+) devices are shown.

The resulting web page also makes it easy for users to search the table for interesting devices.
