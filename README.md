# OpenWrt Table Of Hardware (TOH)

> "The Coolest Thing Since Sliced Bread"

Welcome to the slick, shiny foundation of the new official **Table of Hardware (TOH)** page for OpenWrt, now rocking the internet at [https://toh.openwrt.org](https://toh.openwrt.org). Adopted by the OpenWrt team to ditch the old, clunky setup, this project is here to deliver hardware compatibility data with style, speed, and a sprinkle of open-source swagger.

## Overview

At its core, this bad boy parses the [`toh.json`](https://openwrt.org/toh.json) file—a chaotic, "dirty build" Frankenstein stitched together from OpenWrt wiki entries. We take that mess, polish it up, and serve it fresh for the TOH page, keeping your hardware info accurate and your router dreams alive.

## Features

- **Official TOH Vibes**: Powers the live OpenWrt Table of Hardware at [https://toh.openwrt.org](https://toh.openwrt.org).
- **JSON Wizardry**: Slices and dices [`toh.json`](https://openwrt.org/toh.json) like a ninja chef, turning wiki chaos into structured gold.
- **Community Swagger**: We need YOU—yes, YOU—to jump in and make this thing even cooler.

## Preproduction Sneak Peek
