# OpenWRT Table of Hardware

_(Work In Progress!)_

While OpenWRT is fantastic software, navigating the [Table of Hardware (ToH)](https://openwrt.org/toh/start) can feel like a frustrating maze due to its clunky GUI.

I’m currently working on this project to enhance the user experience. If you find it valuable (and I hope the OpenWRT team does too), I’m prepared to submit a pull request (PR) to include these improvements on the main OpenWRT site. 

### Please test **[my (live) version of the TOH](https://soif.github.io/OpenWrtTOH/)**.

Your feedback would be greatly appreciated!
